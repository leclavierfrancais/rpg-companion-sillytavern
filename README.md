## ⚙️ Settings

### Main Panel Controls

- **Panel Position**: Left or Right side of the chat

### Generation Modes

#### Together Mode

Tracker data is generated within the main AI response and automatically extracted:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Trackers + Full roleplay response

↓ Extension extracts tracker data from response

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Main chat shows clean roleplay text

Pros:
- Single API call
- Faster response
- Simpler setup

Cons:
- Tracker formatting mixed in AI response
- May affect roleplay quality slightly

#### Separate Mode

Tracker data is generated in a separate API call after the main response:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Pure roleplay response - no tracker data

AI: Separate call with just the tracker data

↓ Extension sends separate request with context

↓ AI generates only tracker data

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Context summary injected into next generation

Pros:
- Clean roleplay responses
- Better roleplay quality
- Contextual summary enhances immersion

Cons:
- Extra API call
- Slightly slower

### Model Selection

- **Use main chat model**: Use the same model as your chat (recommended)
- Custom model selection (coming soon)

## 📝 How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Enable the extension in the Extensions tab
2. Choose your generation mode: Together or Separate
3. Select which panels to display (User Stats, Info Box, Character Thoughts)

## 🚀 Planned Features

- Support for selecting a different model for RPG updates

## 💡 Tips

1. **Context Messages**: Start with 4 messages and adjust based on your needs. More messages = better context but slower updates
2. **Performance**: If updates are slow, consider reducing the context depth or using a faster model
3. **Customization**: You can modify the prompts in index.js to add your own stat categories or change the format

## 📋 Compatibility

- Requires SillyTavern 1.11.0 or higher
- Works with all AI backends (OpenAI, Claude, KoboldAI, etc.)
- Mobile-responsive design
